##  Spring Security Integration
An authentication mechanism allows users to add and update only their own comments. Admin and User roles with session management using JWT (JSON Web Token).

##  Writing Unit Tests
Unit tests for the Service and Controller layers have been created using JUnit and Mockito.

##  Swagger Integration
Use Swagger UI to display endpoint information and provide documentation for the APIs.

##  Project Development
1. **Creating the Spring Boot Project:** A basic Spring Boot project was created using Spring Initializr, and necessary dependencies were added.
2. **Configuring Database Connection:** The `application.properties` file was updated with the database connection details.
3. **Creating Model, Repository, and Service Classes:** Film, User, and Comment models were created; repository interfaces were defined, and service classes were implemented.
4. **Writing Controller Classes:** Controller classes were created to define the API endpoints.
5. **Integrating Spring Security:** Spring Security configurations were made for user registration and login processes.
6. **Writing Unit Tests:** Test scenarios were added to the service and controller layers.
7. **Using Docker:** Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files were created to dockerize the project.
